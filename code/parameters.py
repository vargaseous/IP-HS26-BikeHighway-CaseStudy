=============
Model inputs, corridor definitions and assumptions for the SBB MehrSpur
Zürich–Winterthur infrastructure analysis.

HOW TO USE
----------
Import assumptions and corridor definitions wherever the model needs them:

    from parameters import CORRIDOR_REGIONS, N_YEARS, DISCOUNT_RATE, ...

STUDENT INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
This file is configured for the SBB MehrSpur project. For your own project
(e.g., a bike highway or mobility hub), adapt these three sections:
1. General parameters: set nominal values, shared appraisal assumptions,and
   physical targets. Stages and their package-specific parameters 
   are defined together in stages.py. A KEY_Y40 value defines that parameter's
   nominal endpoint.
2. Corridor: redefine CORRIDOR_REGIONS/CORRIDOR_MUNICIPALITIES or use explicit
   zone IDs. Configure the counting section and any supplementary flow.
3. Uncertainties: use the same general parameter key, classify its effect as
   transport_modelling or post_modelling, and choose scenarios or sensitivity.
   Removing an uncertainty keeps its general nominal trajectory.
4. Rebuild the surrogate (nor notebooks 03 onwards) after changing the corridor, physical stages,
   transport behaviour, or a transport input or its training domain.

See code/surrogate_model/README.md for the adaptation checklist.
